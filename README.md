# 🌐 Zena Site

A personal creative website built with full control over design and structure. Zena is a hybrid of:

- ✨ Personal Portfolio
- 📸 Instagram-style Image/Video Feed
- 📝 Blog/Vlog Journal

This site is designed to be stylish, expressive, and built from the ground up with modular control for the creator — *you*.
